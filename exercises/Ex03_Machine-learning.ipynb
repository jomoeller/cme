    "It was found to be hard to find meaningful correlations of Rm and A with the chemical compositions based on the qualitative data analysis methods employed before. Therefore, you now want to use the steel data to build a ML model that predicts Rm and A based on the steel chemistry and can subsequently be used to find the optimal composition for the given requirements.\n",

    "First, scale your data using the `RobustScaler`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, train and test a Support Vector Regression ML model to predict Rm and A based on the chemical composition using the default hyper-parameters for `gamma` and `alpha` and using 85% of data for training and 15% for testing. Determine the R2 score, the pearson correlation coefficient, and the mean absolute error (MAE) - on both train and test data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, use `GridSearchCV` to find the optimal set of hyper-parameters using 3-fold cross validation. Also in this case, determine the metrics above mentioned (R2, ...).\n",

    "Finally, plot the results for the optimal set of hyper-parameters as a \"true vs. predicted\" plot."
